Bugs:

  - If a unit is already moving towards a target and the path becomes blocked,
    the unit simply goes through the obstacle.

  - Blocking in the area a unit is moving towards results in a coredump.

  - Units may step out of the way when another unit passes, but never take back
    their old spot.

To do:

  - Unit Improvements:
      -> Prevent two units from occupying the same space.
      -> Move to the closest available square if the goal is occupied or unreachable
      -> Subdivide squares to allow multiple units per square.
      -> Units should be capable of moving out of the way if they block the movement of others.

  - Building Improvements:
      -> Allow multiple wall pieces to be built at once

  - Interface Improvements:
      -> Better sprites
      -> Keyboard shortcuts
      -> Minimap
      -> A small drag on a sidebar button should count as a click
      -> Drag deadzone
      -> Sidebar clicks should return buttons, not pixel coordinates
      -> Allow zooming. Blocks should no longer be fixed at 32x32 pixels.
