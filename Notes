Bugs found:

  - If a unit is already moving towards a target and the path becomes blocked,
    the unit simply goes through the obstacle.

  - It is possible to build on a square that is occupied by a unit.

  - Changing direction while solving a maze results in a coredump.

  - Attempting to build outside of the world -> Crash

To do:

  - If no path exists from S to G, we should attempt to get as close as we can anyway.

  - Tidy up mouse coordinate code - We should already have calculated for this frame by the time we
    call any movement functions.

  - Allow zooming. Blocks should no longer be fixed 32x32 pixel blocks.
