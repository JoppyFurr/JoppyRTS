Bugs found:

  - If a unit is already moving towards a target and the path becomes blocked,
    the unit simply goes through the obstacle.

  - It is possible to build on a square that is occupied by a unit.

  - Changing direction while solving a maze results in a coredump.

  - Attempting to build outside of the world -> Crash

  - Blocking in the area a unit is moving towards results in a coredump.

To do:

  - Tidy up mouse coordinate code - We should already have calculated for this frame by the time we
    call any movement functions.

  - Allow zooming. Blocks should no longer be fixed 32x32 pixel blocks.

  - Code to convert between pixel space and world space

  - Dead zone for dragging

  - Dragging on a button should still press the button if the entire drag is contained in the button

  - Unit Improvements:
      -> Prevent two units from occupying the same space.
      -> Move to the closest available square if the goal is occupied or unreachable
      -> Subdivide squares to allow multiple units per square.
      -> Units should be capable of moving out of the way if they block the movement of others.


Main loop prototype:

    Process SDL Input
        -> Involves converting pixel-space to world-space.

    Process game events
        -> This should not even be aware of pixel-space.

    Simulate
        -> Time passes, units move.

    Render
        -> Take the game state, and spit out a frame.

    Framelimit
        -> 60 fps is enough for now.

Implementation steps:
    Break mouse input into a seperate file. Only a world-space data structure should be exposede.
