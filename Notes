Bugs found:

  - If a unit is already moving towards a target and the path becomes blocked,
    the unit simply goes through the obstacle.

  - It is possible to build on a square that is occupied by a unit.

  - Changing direction while solving a maze results in a coredump.

  - Attempting to build outside of the world -> Crash

To do:

  - Tidy up mouse coordinate code - We should already have calculated for this frame by the time we
    call any movement functions.

  - Allow zooming. Blocks should no longer be fixed 32x32 pixel blocks.

  - Unit Improvements:
      -> Buildings should not be placable on units.
      -> Prevent two units from occupying the same space.
      -> Move to the closest available square if the goal is occupied or unreachable
      -> Subdivide squares to allow multiple units per square.
      -> Rectangle selection.
      -> Units should be capable of moving out of the way if they block the movement of others.
